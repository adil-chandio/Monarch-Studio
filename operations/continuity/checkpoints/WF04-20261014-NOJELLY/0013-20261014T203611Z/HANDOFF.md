# Resume capsule — WF04-20261014-NOJELLY

**Status:** `waiting_external`  
**Title:** Monarch Face: original scenes and articulated motion, no plate warps  
**Style:** `monarch-face-chaos`  
**Checkpoint sequence:** 13  
**Last checkpoint:** 2026-10-14T20:36:11Z

## Goal

Replace the user-rejected recycled image-warp film with new scene design and verified joint-driven motion; validate identity and natural movement before attempting a full-length final.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] New visuals, not old plates; no image-space body/face mesh warps; real 3D joint movement with stable feet and neck; crown above MONARCH STUDIO ending; no claims of photoreal likeness or final approval without visual evidence.

## Exact next action

Do not repeat unsupported connector probes, regenerate character/stills, or re-deliver the rejected composite. Await a usable actual-motion render capability or appropriately newly rendered clips to complete the remaining animation/edit. Saved design assets and exact recovery IDs remain in character-first/records/ASSETS.json.
