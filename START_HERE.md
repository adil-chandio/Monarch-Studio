# START HERE

The repository uses one active workflow slot. Do not guess or restart an existing task.

- **Task:** `WF04-20261014-NOJELLY`
- **Status:** `waiting_external`
- **Title:** Monarch Face: original scenes and articulated motion, no plate warps
- **Next action:** Review PR #2 and the delivered live-action draft. Do not re-render completed shots or recreate the PR. A true photoreal generated-action final requires an approved high-detail avatar/action or video-generation pipeline; rough 3D and photo warps must not be presented as that final.
- **Resume capsule:** [`workflows/current/RESUME.md`](workflows/current/RESUME.md)

Run:

```bash
python3 tools/continuity.py resume
python3 tools/studio.py validate
```

Permanent style knowledge is under [`styles/`](styles/). Only currently running work belongs under `workflows/current/`.
